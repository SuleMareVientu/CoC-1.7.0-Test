# CoC-1.7.0
### First open-source server emulator for CoC 1.7.0 with Python!

### Required: a JAILBROKEN Apple device (iPhone, iPod, iPad) with iOS 10 or older, the last version with 32-bit apps support and also Appsync Unified tweak from [Karen's Repo](https://cydia.akemi.ai/) and iFile. Everything tested on iOS 6.1.3.

## Instructions
Sideload CoC 1.7 client iPA from [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/rluoomohvn81bcp/Clash_of_Clans_1.70.ipa/file) with iTunes

Open command prompt and type **`ipconfig`**. Copy the **IPv4 Address** of your internet adapter (Ethernet or Wireless)

Open your iDevice **`/etc/hosts`** with iFile and select **Text Editor**.
Add a line to the end with **`your.local.ip game.clashofclans.com`** and SAVE (where **your.local.ip** is your PC's IPv4 address)

Open server folder in command prompt and run **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**

Run **`start.bat`** and allow Windows firewall

### Enjoy the server!

### **Core and Crypto by zzVertigo, original server by Solaree**

This is just a temporary fix, it'll be useless once Solaree updates his.
